This program is MSYS2 Selector, this small program is handy for selecting the console compilor in the root directory in 'C:\Msys64' on your windows machine and if you want this program for yourself, you can use it with Visual Studio 2015 or VS 2017. Either way, works with both editions without any apparent problems so you can edit the sh!t out of it if you want. :)
BTW, it's licensed under GNU GPL Version 2 license, so go nuts and have fun!
